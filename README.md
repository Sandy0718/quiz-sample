# React-ES6 based Javascript Quiz

This gist contains the code to create a simple "javascript quiz" with react & ES6. In this version, you only see the first layout of the app, where you are presented with some questions and their 4 possible answers. 

##There is no interactivity yet on this app in this version. As we move along, we'll add the interactivity to this project.
